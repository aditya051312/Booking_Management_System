Given the task description, we will be using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and Jest for testing. 

Here are the main components:

1. Login component (Login.jsx): This component will render the login form and handle user input and form submission.

2. Backend server (server.js): This file will set up the Express server and define the /api/login endpoint.

3. Main application file (App.jsx): This file will set up the routing system and configure the default route.

4. Dashboard component (Dashboard.jsx): This component will be displayed to the user after successful login.

5. Login test file (Login.test.js): This file will contain tests for the Login component.

6. Package.json: This file will list all the dependencies for the project.

Now, let's dive into the code for each file:

**Login.jsx**
